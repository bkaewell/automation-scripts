# Microservices Repository

Welcome to the **Micro Services Repository**. This repository serves as a scalable foundation for my microservice architecture. Currently, it includes the **IP Upload** microservice, which is designed to handle IP address data ingestion, processing, and integration with third-party APIs.


```
# Microservices Repository Structure
micro-services/                        # Root directory for all microservices
├── .git/                              # Git version control metadata
├── .gitignore                         # Specifies intentionally untracked files
├── README.md                          # High-level repository documentation (this file)
└── ip_upload/                         # IP Upload microservice (fully implemented)

#### Scaling the Architecture
This repository is built with scalability in mind. As I develop additional microservices, each will reside in its own subdirectory with dedicated setup and usage documentation. I encourage contributions and welcome enhancements to the architecture.

#### Background
The **IP Upload** microservice is designed to:

**Process IP Address Data:** Process IP addresses efficiently.
**Integrate with External APIs:** The service can be configured to work with third-party APIs (i.e. Google Services, ip-api, etc.).
**Operate in a Containerized Environment:** Using Docker and Docker Compose to simplify deployment.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the IP Upload service, please see the README in the ip_upload/ folder.
